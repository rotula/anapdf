Changelog for anapdf
********************

0.4.1 (2020-11-25)
==================

- BUGFIX: use BytesIO instead of SringIO as ``outfp``

==================

- BUGFIX: write_font_index had unicode problems from porting
  to Python 2/3.
- BUGFIX: deal with missing fontmetrics information in font_index
- BUGFIX: deal with special characters (ampersands etc.) when
  writing font_index
- FEATURE: (experimental) allow for a default base font size to
  be specified at TEIConverter instantiation to determine relative
  font sizes (such as upper or lower case in pseudo-smallcaps)

0.3.1 (2019-12-18)
==================

- TEIConverter.add_style: The style dict relied on the
  simplestyle.Style objects as keys, but it is better to use
  the style ID.

  no sizes

==================

- BUGFIX: program crashes when cropbox for single character has no
  horizontal or vertical extension

0.2.2 (2017-07-12)
==================

- change dependency to pdfminer.six-mgh

0.2.1 (2017-01-30)
==================

- Bugfix: fontenc.py did not take into account the font metric
  information in front of the character table (with the result that no
  corrections were being applied to the encoding)

==================

- Added some font metrics information to the font extraction HTML.
